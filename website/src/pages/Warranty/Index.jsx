            The retailer is refurbed that over to the consumer for everyone via
            the Internet platform{" "}

            sub-domains physical products sold, in addition to the statutory
            warranty rights, a voluntary commercial guarantee for the proper and
            error-free functioning under the following conditions. The
            respective term of the warranty is specified by the retailer, but is
            at least 12 months from the date of purchase.
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition, the retailers on refurbed grant the consumer a 30-day
            test phase from receipt of the product. If any physical products
            sold via the Internet platform{" "}
            <strong>www.refurbed.at / www.refurbed.de</strong> (at sub-domains)
            within the 30-day test phase does not meet the expectations of the
            consumer, the consumer is entitled to the seller. Within the 30-day
            test phase, the product can be returned without giving reasons. The
            costs for return shipping are borne by the dealer. In the event of a
            repair or replacement of the product within the 30-day test phase,
            it will remain in place for at least 14 additional days from the
            replacement of the repaired or the repaired or replaced product.
            Replacement or repair of the product within the 30-day test phase
            does not extend this period. The 30-day test phase begins on the day
            of receipt of the product and ends within a reasonable period of
            time at the time of the request. If a replacement or repair is
            elected by the consumer within the 30-day test period, but not
            possible, the retailer will refund the full purchase price including
            shipping costs. The consumer bears the risk of accidental loss and
            accidental damage resulting from improper use.

            Prerequisites and scope of warranty protection for electrical
            appliances
          </h2>

          <p>
            The warranty covers all the technical functions of the purchased
            device. The retailer guarantees that the consumer that the products
            are free from material, manufacturing and design defects. The state
            of science and technology at the time of sale is decisive here. The
            product must have already indicated the defect that cannot be caused
            the damage at this time. Claims for compensation for consequential
            damages exist only in accordance with the mandatory statutory
            provisions.
          </p>

          <p>
            The warranty is valid from the date of purchase for the period
            specified by the retailer. The warranty period begins on the day the
            product is handed over to the consumer. If the product is repaired
            during the warranty period, this means at the time of repair or
            replacement, this is of course not reduced.) An example of this
            would be: The defective device has a warranty claim of 8 months and
            is replaced due to a defect. In this case, the warranty claim of the
            replacement device remains at 8 months. However, if the warranty
            period of the defective device is only 4 months, the warranty for
            the replacement device will be extended to at least 6 months.
          </p>

          <p>
            Furthermore, a distinction is made between two types of warranty
            cases. If only one component is defective, the warranty is extended
            only to the replaced component (e.g. Camera) to at least 6 months.
            However, if the entire device is replaced, the warranty of the
            entire replacement device is extended to at least 6 months.
          </p>

          <p>
            The consumer may exercise the rights arising from this guarantee
            against the retailer by means of a notification of errors in writing
            (warranty application) within the warranty period. The prerequisite
            is also that the consumer always gives the error within 2 months
            after he has recognized or had to recognize him. It is up to the
            consumer to prove that the guarantee has not expired (by example by
            presenting the proof of purchase).
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">
            Services in the warranty claim
          </h2>

          <p>The retailers are free to repair the product or to replace it.</p>

          <p>
            The rule is the repair of the old device, if possible. If this is
            not possible, the trader will ensure an exchange.
          </p>

          <p>
            Upon replacement, the old device is replaced free of charge by an
            equal or higher-value device (same type and quality or at the time
            of the warranty application and the same type).
          </p>

          <p>
            Alternatively, the retailer can reimburse the consumer for the value
            of the device. If the retailer chooses a refund of the device value
            and confirms this in writing, the retailer shall refund the device
            and accessories to the consumer for the value of the device upon
            receipt.
          </p>

            Expiry in case of warranty
          </h2>

          <p>
            If problems arise with devices covered by the above warranty, the
            customer must report directly to the refurbed customer service to
            the refurbed customer service team using the following contact
            details by telephone or e-mail:
          </p>

          <p>Phone: 0800-700 12 10</p>

          <p>E-mail: service.refurbed.de</p>

          <p>
            The refurbed customer service team accepts the warranty application.
            Then refurbed informs the dealer about the warranty application. The
            retailer then sends the customer a return slip by e-mail, with which
            the product can be returned to the retailer free of charge.
          </p>

          <p>
            Before sending, please note that from the packaging it can read to
            factory settings and that all personal data and personal information
            (AppleID, Google Account, etc.) have been removed from the device.
          </p>

          <p>
            If the item has correctly and securely, if the original packaging is
            no longer available, in the alternative packaging, so that no
            transport damage can occur during the transport (e.g. a carton with
            sufficient filling material, an envelope does not count as adequate
            packaging).
          </p>

          <p>
            Important: Only with this return slip is a return possible. The
            device is sent to the retailer free of charge.
          </p>

          <p>
            After receipt of the device, it will be checked by the dealer's
            technicians. The consumer will then receive notification from the
            dealer about the status and, if applicable, a replacement or a
            reasonable replacement device. If the value of the guarantee
            application is paid, the consumer will be refunded to the payment
            method with which the customer ordered the product on refurbed.
            Transportation or shipping may only be carried out with prior
            agreement by the dealer.
